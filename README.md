# Developers Hub Tasks

# Task Objective
This repository aggregates a series of data science and machine learning assignments from the Developers Hub. Each task focuses on applying different models and analyses such as classification, regression, and visualizations using real-world datasets to reinforce understanding of data handling, model selection, and performance evaluation.

# Dataset Used
> Varies by task: includes classic publicly available datasets such as:
> **Iris**, **Stock data of Tesla**, **Heart Disease Dataset**, **House Price Prediction Dataset**
> Formats: CSV

##  Models Applied
Broadly across the tasks, the following models & techniques are leveraged:
> **Supervised Classification**: Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Decision Tree, 
> **Regression**: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression
> **Evaluation Methods**: Train/test split, cross-validation, grid search, performance metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC Score, RMSE/MSE, Confusion Matrices

##  Key Results & Findings
- **Classifier performance**: 
  > Random Forests and SVMs consistently perform best on structured tabular data (e.g. Titanic survival prediction, Iris classification), achieving ~90â€“95% accuracy.
  > Decision Trees offer interpretability but tend to overfit; regularization (pruning or limiting depth) helps.
- **Regression insights**:
  > Simple linear regression provides baseline performance on housing price data.
  > Regularized regression (Ridge/Lasso) reduces overfitting and improves generalization.
- **Cross-validation & hyperparameter tuning** are crucial across all tasks to avoid overfitting and ensure realistic model evaluation.
- **Visualizations** such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importances deepen insight into model strengths and weaknesses.
